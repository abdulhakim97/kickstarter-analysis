Performing an Analysis on a Kick Starter Data
# Kickstarting with Excel
  - By Abdulhakim Mohamed

## Overview of Project & Purpose 
  -	The Purpose of this project is to analyze the outcome of both the launch date and the funding goals and determine the difference between them.


## Analysis and Challenges
  -	The Challenges of this analysis was to filter out a lot of the categories that werenâ€™t needed for this data set. Then after separating the categories using some mathematical formulas to find the success, failed and canceled rate of the outcomes and determining the percentages of each of them.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

  - Judging based soley on the data you could see that the success rate is at a much higher rate than the other 2 categories in the theater subcategories, while failed is at a much lower rate and cancelled is completley none exsistent. This Data shows that the theater outcomes launch date is looking at a high success rate.



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

  - Looking soley at the data the successful rate starts off high but than drops to a much lower level, completly different from the failed rate counter part. This indicates that meeting the requierd goal is much easier as the goal is under $15,000. If higher than the outcome of failure increase significantly overtime. 


## Results

## What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  - The first conclusion is that its success rate overall is at a very high percent.
  - The second conclusion is that it never gets canceled, which makes it very safe.

## What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  - If the required Goal is above $15,000 than it is mostly likey not able to reach its goals and fail, however if it is below that number than it will mostl likely successed. 

## What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - There were prehaps a couple of outliers that didn't help the data set for example some the canceled rate were all complete zeros which could have skewed all of the points.

## What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - A pledge vs goals type of graph which could show which categories passes the thershold.
